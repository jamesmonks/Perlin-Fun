# Perlin-Fun

Coded from scratch, this JavaScript library creates natural looking textures.

I created additional functionality for my uses of this library, and you can see an implementation in my programmatic art "[sunset](https://jamesmonks.github.io/Sunset)".

# About This Project

In learning to implement this algorithm, I gained an understanding of the math behind it and how to represent it into code. This project will continue to have functionality added to solve different problems involving natural looking noise and textures.
